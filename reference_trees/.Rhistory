##### Nye similarity scores #####
#
# Nye similarity is a generalized Robinson-Foulds metric. It finds the optimal matching that pairs each branch
# from one tree with a branch in the second and scores matches according to the size of the largest split that is
# consistent with both of them. It is then normalized against the Jaccard index.
#
# Since the following scores are similarity scores, they range from 0-1 with 1 being a perfect match.
#
# Aim 1: 0.6906
# Aim 2 (both): 0.8417
